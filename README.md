## Laboratory work for the Tinkoff Generation DL fall'22 course
### License plate recognition systems consist of two modules: detection and character Recognition (Optical Character Recognition, OCR). The detector selects a rectangle with a number from the image, and OCR converts it into text. We will assume that the detector has already been implemented. As part of the project, it is proposed to independently train the OCR module for car license plates.
